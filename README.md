# Fix-accessibility-standards

## The goal of this project was to refactor a clean, responsive, properly styled website for the company heriseon. We edited the html so that it provides semantic elements. We consolidated the CSS so that it was properly styled and got rid of any bugs that slowed down the user from loading the page. I learned how to properly style css based on classes and id's.
